After a year and a half of so much effort, we are happy to announce that our book has finally reached the production stage. Now it will go through the process of copy editing, typesetting and more so that we and Manning can make sure we deliver the best product to you.

Thank you for being with us all this time, we truly appreciate your support and feedback. Soon we hope we can all get the printed copy in our hands.

We'd like to wish all of our readers and their families a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! We hope you get to have a special time with those you love.
