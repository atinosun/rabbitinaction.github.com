RabbitMQ in Action has entered the [Manning Early Access Programm](http://bit.ly/rabbitmq) so you can have access to the first three chapters already. Of course we very welcome your [feedback](http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=720).

> In this blog we plan to share content related to *RabbitMQ* and our book *RabbitMQ in Action*. Expect to find articles, code examples and more soon!
